## A Primer on Flux

Flux is an architecture concept to describe "one way" data flow with the Flux Dispatcher and a Javascript event library.

'One way' means that data flows as follows.

1. Dispatcher receives Actions
1. Dispatcher updats Stores
1. Store Emits a "Change" Event
1. View Responds to the "Change" Event

### Step One: Dispatcher receives Actions

For example, user clicks on a button.

```html
<button onClick={ this.createNewItem }>New Item</button>
```

Your component dispachs an action to the Dispatcher.

```javascript
var AppDispatcher = new Dispatcher();

var MyButton = React.createClass({
  createNewItem: function( evt ) {
    AppDispatcher.dispatch({
      eventName: 'new-item',
      newItem: { name: 'Marco' } // example data
    });
  }
});
```

This demo uses [Facebook's official Dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/src/Dispatcher.js) and [MicroEvent.js](http://notes.jetienne.com/2011/03/22/microeventjs.html) as the event library.

```javascript
var Dispatcher = require('flux').Dispatcher;
var MicroEvent = require('./lib/MicroEvent.js');
```

### Step two: Dispatcher updats Stores

You need a store to keep your state. A store is a singleton, meaning you probably shouldn't declare it with new.

> Stores contain the application state and logic. Their role is somewhat similar to a model in a traditional MVC, but they manage the state of many objects.... More than simply managing a collection of ORM-style objects, stores manage the application state for a particular domain within the application. -- Facebook

```javascript
// Global object representing list data and logic
var ListStore = {

    // Actual collection of model data
    items: [],

    // Accessor method we'll use later
    getAll: function() {
        return this.items;
    }

};
```

Your store then responds to the dispatched event. `AppDispatcher.register` method is used to register a callback for `AppDispatcher.dispatch`.

```javascript
AppDispatcher.register( function( payload ) {

    switch( payload.eventName ) {

        case 'new-item':

            // We get to mutate data!
            ListStore.items.push( payload.newItem );
            break;

    }

    return true; // Needed for Flux promise resolution

});
```

The dispatcher only exists to send messages from views to stores.

> When the dispatcher responds to an action, all stores in the application are sent the data payload provided by the action via the callbacks in the registry. ([Facebookâ€™s React page on GitHub](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html))

### Step three: Store Emits a "Change" Event

> Your store emits an event, but not using the dispatcher. This is confusing, but it's the Flux way. Let's give our store the ability to trigger events.

```javascript
MicroEvent.mixin( ListStore );
```

Then let's trigger the change event in your Dispatcher.

```javascript
AppDispatcher.register( function( payload ) {

    switch( payload.eventName ) {

        case 'new-item':

            // We get to mutate data!
            ListStore.items.push( payload.newItem );
            // Tell the world we changed!
            ListStore.trigger( 'change' );
            break;

    }

    return true; // Needed for Flux promise resolution

});
```

### Step four: View Responds to the "Change" Event

> let's listen for the change event from our ListStore when the component "mounts," which is when the component is first created.

```javascript
componentDidMount: function() {
  ListStore.bind( 'change', this.listChanged );
},

listChanged: function() {
  // Since the list changed, trigger a new render.
  this.forceUpdate();
},

componentWillUnmount: function() {
  ListStore.unbind( 'change', this.listChanged );
},
```

Finally, our render function.

```javascript
render: function() {

    // Remember, ListStore is global!
    // There's no need to pass it around
    var items = ListStore.getAll();

    // Build list items markup by looping
    // over the entire list
    var itemHtml = items.map( function( listItem ) {

        // "key" is important, should be a unique
        // identifier for each list item
        return <li key={ listItem.id }>
            { listItem.name }
          </li>;

    });

    return <div>
        <ul>
            { itemHtml }
        </ul>

        <button onClick={ this.createNewItem }>New Item</button>

    </div>;
}
```

### Differences from MVC

(The real problem with MVC is) there's not a lot of consensus for what MVC is exactly - lots of people have different ideas about what it is. What we're really arguing against is bi-directional data flow, where one change can loop back and have cascading effects.

The dispatcher doesn't play the same role as controllers. There's no business logic in the dispatcher, and we use the same dispatcher code in multiple applications. It's just a central hub for events to reach interested subscribers (usually stores). But it's important in Flux because that's where the single-directional data flow is enforced.

A controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., by scrolling through a document).

A dispatcher cannot do any of that, the commands have to start from somewhere else (views, server responses, live updates) and pass through the dispatcher.
